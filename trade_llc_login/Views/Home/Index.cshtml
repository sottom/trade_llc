        IDEA 1 – Trade LLC Site

        Create an MVC website that will allow buyers to ask questions of Bob.
        On the landing page I want you to implement a bootstrap jumbotron class to create a “call to action” which for now will not have any functionality
            (If you don’t know what a call to action is, google it!). The landing page
            (home page), should also display any content that is relevant to Trade LLC
            (i.e. quotes, videos, etc. – be creative)
        On the landing page there will be three main links:
        Products – should take you to the products view
        The products view will have a dropdown that will consist of
            (for now) three products
            (you will choose any 3 products which have been hardcoded into the dropdown).
        As the user clicks on an entry in the product list, take them to another view
            (_____ product FAQ’s) which is dynamically loaded using source code.                                        ??????????????????????????
            For now, the questions and answers on the view for each product will all be the same
            (HARD CODED - You will create the question and answer), regardless of which product is chosen.
            You must however pass the following unique information for each product in the viewbag:


        product name
        seller's name
        sellers address
        type of product (berry, bean, nut)
        where the product came from
        customer satisfaction rating
        a picture or symbolfor the product


        You will need to display all of this information in a section above the FAQ’s on the dynamically loaded view.
            Please make it look professional. Talk with classmates and talk about the most effective ways to display this information.
        At the top of the each dynamically created view, you will display a bootstrap breadcrumb
            (Google it!) that will help the user better navigate your site. Using this breadcrumb menu,
            the user should be able to go back to the products page to select a different product.
        At the very bottom of each dynamically created product’s FAQ’s will be a question form.
            The user will be able to fill out this form to post a new question, just like you would post a comment on Facebook.
            ** For project 1 we will not be posting the questions or saving them in the database, we just want the form to be there and available.
        Under each FAQ question, there will also need to be a way for a user to answer that specific question,                        ???????????????????????????????????
            so you will need to add a reply button in order to have a response form dynamically created when a
            Buyer wants to answer another buyer’s question. You do not need to save the replies for this project.


        About us- should take you to the about view
        The About view should display “made up” information about the company that wants to help future buyers get
            questions about their desired products answered by those that have bought the product


        Contact – should take you to the contact view
        The contact view will have basic company information, such as phone number and email.
            The view will also have a contact form that will have fields for the user’s name, email, subject(choose from a list), and message body.
        There will need to be a submit button at the bottom of the contact form. This button however,
            won’t do anything with the data yet. For now it will just clear the text in the form.
